# Dissertation

This repository contains the codebase for my dissertation project, which focuses on implementing and exploring various optimization algorithms for solving a specific problem. 
## Files and Modules

### 1. `Automatic.m`

This file serves as the main configuration hub for the project. Users are encouraged to modify the parameters within this file to customize the behaviour of the algorithms according to their specific needs.

### 2. `ADMM.m`

The `ADMM.m` module implements the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. ADMM is corresponding to Section 3 of dissertation.

### 3. `diag_generator.m`

The `diag_generator.m` module is responsible for generating a diagonal matrix containing singular values. This matrix is a required input for the `IP_PMM.m` algorithm.

### 4. `QP_generator.m`

The `QP_generator.m` module involves the conversion of the ADMM formulation into a specialized optimization technique called Improved Primal-Dual Method of Multipliers (IPPMM). This transformation is a key step in enhancing the algorithm's performance and convergence.

### 5. `Displayer.m`

The `Displayer.m` module is responsible for extracting and presenting the optimal solution obtained through the IPPMM algorithm. It provides visualizations and summaries to facilitate result interpretation.

### 6. `IP_PMM.m`

The `IP_PMM.m` module houses the implementation of the Interior-Point Method of Multipliers (IPPMM) algorithm. This is corresponding to Section 4 of dissertation. 

## 7. `ls_gen_underdetermined.m`

The `ls_gen_underdetermined.m` module is a modified version of the IGen2 algorithm. In this version, enhancements have been made, including the incorporation of the OsGen1 generator and the introduction of sparsity control mechanisms.

## Attribution and Sources

The core IPPMM algorithm implemented in `IP_PMM.m` is based on the work available at [https://github.com/spougkakiotis/IP_PMM](https://github.com/spougkakiotis/IP_PMM). We acknowledge the contributions of the authors and researchers behind this implementation.

The foundation for the `ls_gen_underdetermined.m` module can be traced back to the original IGen2 algorithm, hosted at [https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/ERGO/trillion/](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/ERGO/trillion/). Our modifications build upon this foundation to enhance its capabilities for our project's specific needs.

## Usage

To use this codebase, follow these steps:

1. Adjust the parameters in `Automatic.m` to match your problem requirements.
2. Run the modules in the order specified above to execute the optimization algorithms.
3. Extract and interpret results using the visualizations and outputs generated by `Displayer.m`.

Please refer to the documentation within each module for detailed information on function inputs, outputs, and usage guidelines.
